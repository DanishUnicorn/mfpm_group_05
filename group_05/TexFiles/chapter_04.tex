\section{Introduction}  
Many enzymes have been identified in milk fat globules (MFGs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), with advancements in proteomic techniques continuously expanding this knowledge. However, many of these enzymes are present in low abundance and often originate from endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi membranes, or cytosolic remnants. A large proportion remains inactive in milk due to the absence of relevant substrates or a suitable environment. This chapter focuses on sulfhydryl oxidase, catalase, lactoperoxidase (LPO), xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), $\gamma$-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and 5'-nucleotidase, discussing their relevance in mammary gland biology, milk integrity, and physiological function upon consumption \cite*{RM_01}.
