\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phospholipids (PL) in Milk: Estimates of PL content in bovine milk vary (0.9–2.3\% of total lipids) depending on extraction methods (Röse Gottlieb vs. Folch extraction).
    \item Milk Fat Globule Membrane (MFGM): Contains 60–65\% of milk PL, with the remaining 35–40\% found in the skim milk phase.
    \item Extracellular Vesicles (EVs): Recently recognized nano-sized phospholipid structures in skim milk, distinct from milk fat globules, but involved in intercellular communication.
    \item Membrane-Associated Enzymes: Identified in both MFGs and EVs, but their abundance is generally low. Many originate from ER, Golgi, or cytosolic crescents.
    \item Activity Considerations: Many of these enzymes remain inactive in milk due to the absence of substrates or unsuitable environmental conditions.
    \item Scope of Discussion: The summary will focus on enzymes relevant to mammary gland biology, milk integrity, and physiological functions upon consumption, excluding those related to lipid synthesis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sulfhydryl Oxidase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sulfhydryl Oxidase (EC 1.8.3.2): Catalyzes oxidation of protein thiols (cysteine residues) to form disulfide bonds, reducing oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.
    \item Types in Milk: Exists in metal-dependent and flavin-dependent forms.
    \item Early Studies:
    \subitem Iron-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase (89-kDa, contains iron) was initially reported (Janolino \& Swaisgood, 1975).
    \subitem Later studies failed to confirm its presence (Jaje et al., 2007).
    \item Current Understanding:
    \subitem Flavin-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX1) is well-documented in bovine milk.
    \subitem Sequence analysis confirmed it as part of the Quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase family.
    \item Membrane Association:
    \subitem Initially believed to be strongly associated with phospholipid membranes (Kitchen, 1974).
    \subitem Later studies suggest a looser association, making it a more soluble protein (Jaje et al., 2007).
    \item Proteomic Evidence: QSOX1 has been identified in membrane fractions of both human and bovine milk (Liao et al., 2011; Reinhardt et al., 2013).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Structure of Flavin-Dependent Sulfhydryl Oxidase}
\begin{itemize}
    \item QSOX1 Splice Variants:
    \subitem QSOX1-L (Long form, 79.6 kDa): Contains a transmembrane region.
    \subitem QSOX1-S (Short form, 63.8 kDa): Lacks most of exon 12 and is more soluble.
    \subitem QSOX1-S is more prevalent than QSOX1-L, including in mammary-derived cell lines.

    \item Structural Features:
    \subitem Multi-domain enzyme derived from fusion of two ancient genes.
    \subitem Contains thioredoxin (Trx) domains, FAD-binding module, CxxC motifs (common in redox reactions).
    \subitem QSOX1-L has a membrane-spanning region, while QSOX1-S does not.

    \item QSOX1 in Bovine Milk:
    \subitem Jaje et al. (2007) isolated sulfhydryl oxidase from bovine skim milk, identifying it as QSOX1-L, though later studies suggest it was likely QSOX1-S.
    \subitem The enzyme migrated as a 62 kDa band in SDS-PAGE.

    \item Biological Significance:
    \subitem QSOX1 expression is linked to tumorigenesis (Antwi et al. 2009; Katchman et al. 2013).
    \subitem QSOX1-S has been isolated from mammalian blood serum (Israel et al. 2014).
    \subitem QSOX1-L can be proteolytically modified and secreted into the extracellular matrix, possibly after removal of its transmembrane domain (Rudolf et al. 2013).
    \subitem Dimerization of QSOX1 has been demonstrated in the same study.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Biological Role of Flavin-Dependent Sulfhydryl Oxidase and Significance in Milk}

\begin{itemize}
    \item QSOX1 in High Secretory Cells:

    \subitem Overexpressed in breast tissue, pancreas, and prostate cancer, suggested as a diagnostic cancer marker.
    \subitem Also linked to heart failure diagnosis.
    
    \item Function in Milk:
    \subitem May contribute to protein folding, but exact substrates remain unidentified.
    \subitem "Cooked" and "flat" off-flavou
    rs in UHT milk are associated with sulfur-containing compounds, methyl ketones, and aldehydes.
    \subitem QSOX1 may impact oxidation of these compounds; 60\% of its activity remains post-pasteurization.

    \item Catalytic Properties:
    \subitem Activity measured using GSH or reduced RNase at pH 7, producing a yellow product (412 nm absorption).
    \subitem Oxidation of thiol substrates generates hydrogen peroxide aerobically; ferricenium ion acts as an alternative electron acceptor anaerobically.
    \subitem Reduction with dithionite or dithiothreitol forms a two-electron intermediate (EH2) with a charge transfer band at 560 nm.
    \subitem Redox-active disulfide bridge involved in catalysis, with similarities to pyridine nucleotide dependent disulfide oxidoreductases.

    \item Comparison with Other QSOX1 Enzymes:
    \subitem Bovine milk QSOX1 has slightly higher kcat/Km values than the chicken egg white enzyme for oxidation of DTT, glutathione, and reduced RNase.
    \subitem Differences may stem from variations in electron flow mechanisms.

    \item Stability and Heat Sensitivity:
    \subitem Catalase is highly heat-sensitive, similar to alkaline phosphatase (Hirvi et al. 1996).
    \subitem Activity is significantly reduced after heating at 72 \textdegree C for 15 s (Griffiths 1986).
    \subitem Some evidence suggests catalase activity increases after pasteurization due to release from somatic cells and bacteria.
    \subitem Variability in catalase activity may contribute to challenges in raw milk cheese ripening (Gatti et al. 2014; Yoon et al. 2016).
    \subitem Due to post-pasteurization variability, catalase is unsuitable as a pasteurization index.

    \subitem First isolated from milk by Ito and Akuzawa (1983a), purified 23,000-fold and crystallized.
    \subitem Three isozymes were identified in milk catalase (Ito and Akuzawa 1983b).
    \subitem SDS dissociation showed subunits ranging from 11 to 55 kDa.
    \subitem Similar in structure to bovine liver catalase, a homotetramer of 60–65 kDa (total mass 250 kDa).
    \subitem Heterogeneity in milk catalase likely results from proteolysis during isolation.

    \item Catalase Activity Measurement:
    \subitem Traditionally measured by monitoring H$_2$O$_2$ disappearance at 240 nm (Beers and Sizer 1952).
    \subitem New and more sensitive assay methods continue to be developed (Hadwan 2018).

    \subitem XOR is a dimer of identical monomers, each with 1332 residues and four redox centers: 2Fe/2S clusters, FAD, and molybdopterin (Berglund et al. 1996).
    \subitem XO catalyzes xanthine oxidation with O$_2$ reduction, while XD uses NAD$^+$ (Hille, 2013).

    \item Interconversion Between XO and XD:
    \subitem XD is the native form; XO results from oxidation or proteolysis (Stirpe \& Della Corte, 1968).
